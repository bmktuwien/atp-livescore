# ATP Livescore

A simple toy program implemented in Haskell, which searches the web
for live tennis scores and shows them in certain time intervals
as desktop notifications.

Currenlty the scores are fetched only from "tennislive.at" and the
notifications are only supported where `libnotify` library is available.
